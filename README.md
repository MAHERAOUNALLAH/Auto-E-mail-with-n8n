ðŸš€ New Automation Project Completed !

Iâ€™ve just finished building an AI-powered email automation workflow with n8n â€” and Iâ€™m really proud of the result!

Hereâ€™s what it does:
âœ… Fetches Gmail messages automatically on schedule
âœ… Uses an AI Agent to read, summarize, and prepare responses
âœ… Formats the replies directly in HTML for a clean, professional look
âœ… Sends back the response automatically to keep communication smooth

This project gave me hands-on practice with:
ðŸ”¹ Workflow automation in n8n
ðŸ”¹ AI integration using OpenRouter
ðŸ”¹ HTML email formatting for professional replies

I believe automation + AI is the future of communication, and this is just a small step toward smarter workflows.

ðŸ’¡ Always happy to exchange ideas with anyone working on AI, automation, or productivity projects!
